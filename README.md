# Hypixel-Bot--Siegmeyer-of-Catarina-
The discord bot for Hypixel and PB2, created by Eric Engel II

## A small note.
This discord bot runs on the now defunct discord.jsv11
Bots now use v12, and we're expecting v13 soon.
Meaning this bot WILL NOT WORK. It is only for a learning reference for others.



### Dependencies

In order to use the bot, you will need node.js ( https://nodejs.org/en/ ) Get the recommended version and install that.

The other dependencies are:
```
discord.js
request
mojang-api
url
sqlite
```
Install these into the directory where you store the bot. Then create a folder called 'db'

Edit the example config, rename it 'config' and replace the needed json values with API keys. Only required keys are Hypixel API key and googl shortening API key.
NOTE: Sometime around May, google will be shutting down its URL shortener and changing to a different system. I do not know when I will be updating the code to account for this, because those who already have hteir API Keys won't be cut off. If you really need it, contact me and I will see to it.

## Purpose

This bot was created to help manage the 1000+ members of the PB2 community, along with give an easy access way for people to pull statistics from PB2 and the Hypixel Network on Discord.

## Contributing

I'm always open to working with other developers. Feel free to email me at mrmcshroom@gmail.com or discord me at MrMcShroom#4652 .

## Acknowledgements

This bot was a huge project and probably my biggest and most successful to date. I'd like to thank the people in the Discord.js Discord Guild for helping me learn to work with the Discord API, and the fellas over on the Hypixel Network Forums for inspiring me and helping me sort out confusing API values.
