# Hypixel-Bot--Siegmeyer-of-Catarina-
The discord bot for Hypixel and PB2, created by MrMcShroom

## Getting Started

If you're only interested in using the bot as I run it, you can do that by visiting our website, http://mcshroom.com/bot 
Otherwise, keep reading here to set it up on your own.

### Dependencies

In order to use the bot, you will need node.js ( https://nodejs.org/en/ ) Get the recommended version and install that.

The other dependencies are:
```
discord.js
request
mojang-api
url
sqlite
```
Install these into the directory where you store the bot. Then create a folder called 'db'

Edit the example config, rename it 'config' and replace the needed json values with API keys. Only required keys are Hypixel API key and googl shortening API key.

## Purpose

This bot was created to help manage the 1000+ members of the PB2 community, along with give an easy access way for people to pull statistics from PB2 and the Hypixel Network on Discord.
You can read a full rundown of commands and uses on our website, http://mcshroom.com/bot

## Acknowledgements

This bot was a huge project and probably my biggest and most successful to date. I'd like to thank the people in the Discord.js Discord Guild for helping me learn to work with the Discord API, and the fellas over on the Hypixel Network Forums for inspiring me and helping me sort out confusing API values.
